[Use Map to Double Values in Array](https://www.codewars.com/kata/53951fff369894e4f10007a9)

Make the double() function return a new array with each value twice as large as the corresponding value in the passed in array. Your solution must use the map() function of the built-in javascript Array object. If you're not familiar with map(), reading over the documentation may help.
